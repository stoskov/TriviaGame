Design and implement a web client application working with questions. It should support users registration, start a new game with questions, addition of questions and addition of categories. Any registered user can start playing and to answer questions. Through a central server system users "trivia game" can begin playing when they get 10 questions in a particular category. each user can view the results of each registered user. System "trivia game" should work in client-server mode. clients (web browsers) communicate with the server (not directly) by sending requests with rest json-serialized data.
